This is the final project of the course “Learning Computer Networks for Beginners”. The project focuses on setting up a secure web server environment using NGINX. The project emphasizes server management skills and security optimization. The server acts as a reverse proxy with access control mechanisms such as rate limiting and port tuning to enhance security. This configuration protects backend services and manages traffic efficiently, showcasing skills in network security, server optimization, and creating a resilient web infrastructure.
